# Data Prepper

Data Prepper is a server side data collector with abilities to filter, enrich, transform, normalize and aggregate data for downstream analytics and visualization.

Data Prepper allows users to build custom pipelines to improve their operational view of their own applications. Two common uses for Data Prepper are trace and log analytics. [Trace Anaytics]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observability-plugins/trace/index/) can help you visualize this flow of events and identify performance problems. [Log Anayltics]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observability-plugins/log-analytics/index) can improve searching, analyzing and provide insights into your application.

To get started building your own custom pipelines with Data Prepper, see the [Get Started]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observability-plugins/data-prepper/get-started/) guide.
